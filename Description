Here are the steps for implementing the Zomato Analytics Dashboard in Power BI based on the provided requirements:

Steps for Zomato Analytics Dashboard in Power BI
1. Requirement Gathering
Objective: Understand and collect detailed requirements for the dashboard from stakeholders.
Actions:
Define KPIs (Total Orders, Average Delivery Time, Average Order Value, Customer Satisfaction, Discount Utilization Rate).
Determine data sources (Orders, Restaurant, Reviews datasets).
Finalize visualizations (line chart, bar chart, pie chart).
Identify filters (Date Range, City/Location, Cuisine Type, Rating Range, Discount Applied).
2. Data Preparation
Objective: Prepare and clean the data for analysis in Power BI.
Actions:
Import datasets (Orders, Restaurant, and Reviews) into Power BI.
Cleanse data by handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
Create necessary relationships between datasets (e.g., Order ID, Restaurant Name).
Transform the data (e.g., calculate average delivery time, total orders, and average order value).
3. Design KPIs and Visualizations
Objective: Design KPIs and visual elements for insights into performance metrics.
Actions:
KPI Visuals:
Total Orders KPI: Count of orders for the selected period.
Average Delivery Time KPI: Average delivery time.
Average Order Value KPI: Total revenue divided by the number of orders.
Customer Satisfaction KPI: Average rating from customers.
Discount Utilization KPI: Percentage of discounted orders.
Charts/Visualizations:
Total Orders Trend: Line chart for order volume over time.
Delivery Time Analysis: Bar chart to compare average delivery times by city.
Top Restaurants: Horizontal bar chart for the top 10 restaurants by revenue.
Customer Ratings Distribution: Pie chart/bar chart to show rating breakdown.
Cuisine Popularity: Bar chart for the most popular cuisines based on order count.
4. Create Filters and Interactivity
Objective: Add interactive elements to allow users to filter and drill down data.
Actions:
Add Date Range filter to adjust the period for viewing the data.
Add City/Location filter to view performance by location.
Add Cuisine Type filter to narrow down the analysis based on cuisines.
Add Rating Range filter for customer ratings.
Add a toggle for viewing discounted and non-discounted orders.
5. Performance Optimization
Objective: Ensure the dashboard performs well even with large datasets.
Actions:
Optimize Power BI models by removing unnecessary columns and aggregating data.
Use Power BIâ€™s data model features like aggregations, calculated columns, and measures to improve performance.
Test performance and ensure the dashboard loads in under 5 seconds for datasets under 50,000 rows.
6. Deploy and Test
Objective: Finalize the dashboard and deploy it for feedback.
Actions:
Conduct internal testing to ensure data accuracy and functionality.
Gather feedback from stakeholders (business analysts, operations, marketing, restaurant owners).
Adjust visualizations and KPIs as per feedback.
7. User Training and Documentation
Objective: Train users and provide documentation for long-term use.
Actions:
Conduct training sessions for stakeholders on how to use the dashboard and interpret the data.
Provide documentation on the Power BI dashboard features, filters, and KPIs.
8. Deployment
Objective: Deploy the final dashboard to the production environment.
Actions:
Publish the Power BI dashboard to the Power BI service.
Share the dashboard with stakeholders and set up any necessary user permissions.
9. Ongoing Maintenance
Objective: Ensure long-term sustainability and scalability.
Actions:
Monitor data updates and performance.
Address any new requirements or feedback from stakeholders.
Ensure the dashboard can scale to handle larger datasets (up to 1 million rows).
